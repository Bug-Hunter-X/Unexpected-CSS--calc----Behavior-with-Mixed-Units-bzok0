The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use `calc()` with percentages and other units incorrectly, it can lead to unexpected results. For example, using `width: calc(50% + 10px);` is fine, but using something like `width: calc(50% + 10%);` can cause issues because you're adding two different units without proper conversion.
