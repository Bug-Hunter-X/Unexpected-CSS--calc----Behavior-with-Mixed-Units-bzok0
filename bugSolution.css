The `calc()` function in CSS is powerful, but requires careful attention to unit compatibility.  To solve this issue, ensure that the units used within `calc()` expressions are compatible.  For example:

* Avoid adding percentages to percentages or pixels to ems without proper unit conversion.
* When using percentages and other units, make sure you convert them into compatible units before adding them.

Here's the corrected CSS:
```css
.container {
  width: calc(50% + 10px);
}
```
This corrected code ensures that the calculation is performed with consistent units, resolving the issue of an unexpected width.
